# How to build:
Both thprac and marketeer_server include Visual Studio solutuions that can be built with Visual Studio 2022, but make sure that Windows XP support for the Visual Studio 2017 (v141) tools is installed.
marketeer_server includes a Visual Studio solution for building on Windows but the code can be built on Linux (assuming wolfssl and nng are installed through your package manager) by just running `make`
